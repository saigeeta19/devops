Docker is a platform that enables developers to develop, deploy, and run applications in isolated containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different computing environments. Here are some key reasons why Docker is widely used:
Isolation: Docker containers provide process isolation, allowing applications to run in a controlled environment with their own filesystem, network, and resources. This isolation ensures that changes or issues in one container do not affect others, making applications more reliable and secure.
